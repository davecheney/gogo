gogo
====

`gogo` is an alternative build tool for the Go programming language.

usage
-----

`gogo` is not ready for use, you'd be mad to use it. In the case that you _are_ mad, create a project workspace 

    mkdir $PROJECT
    mkdir $PROJECT/.project

    cd $PROJECT
    gogo $SOME_PACKAGE_OR_COMMAND

`gogo` expects all your source to be in $PROJECT/src in GOPATH format.
